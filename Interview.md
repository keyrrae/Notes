Why Behavioral Questions
As stated earlier, interviews usually start and end with “chit chat” or “soft skills.” This is a time
to answer questions about your resume or general questions, and also an opportunity for
you to ask questions. This part of the interview is targeted not only at getting to know you,
but also at relaxing you.
Be Specific, Not Arr


public HashMap<Integer, Student> buildMap(Student[] students) {

HashMap<Integer, Student> map = new HashMap<Integer, Student>();

for (Student s : students) map.put(s.getId(), s);

return map;
}


public String makeSentence(String[] words) {

StringBuffer sentence = new StringBuffer();

for (String w : words) sentence.append(w);

return sentence.toString();
}
