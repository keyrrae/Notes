##`final`, `finally` and `finalize`
###`final`

`final` can be used to mark a variable "unchangeable"

    private final String name = "foo";  //the reference name can never change

`final` can also make a method not "overrideable"

    public final String toString() {  return "NULL"; }

`final` can also make a class not "inheritable". i.e. the class can not be subclassed.

    public final class finalClass {...}
    public class classNotAllowed extends finalClass {...} // Not allowed

###`finally`

`finally` is used in a try/catch statement to "always" execute code 

    lock.lock();
    try {
      //do stuff
    } catch (SomeException se) {
      //handle se
    } finally {
      lock.unlock(); //always executed, even if Exception or Error or se
    }
  
Java 7 has a new try with resources statement that you can use to automatically close resources that explicitly or implicitly implement java.io.Closeable or java.lang.AutoCloseable

###`finalize`

`finalize` is called when an object is garbage collected. You rarely need to override it. An example:

    public void finalize() {
      //free resources (e.g. unallocate memory)
      super.finalize();
    }
