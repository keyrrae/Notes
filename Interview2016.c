They first ask some concept questions about different data structure. 
What is the difference between vector and linked list? 
And then they asked me what did two functions do(the two functions did the same job and he showed this two on his terminal), which one is faster. The time function was already there, just call it.

Interview
I handed my resume on College's career fair and got one phone interview. basic of c programming in Linux . I did get the offer. Maybe because I take too many time on the second question(you should know how to use gettimeofday() in c). It not a difficult test. But I messed up.

Interview Questions
1.remove repeat elements from list
2.test run time
*/
//Verify BST
//Could you have malloc metadata at the end of your block ? If yes, how could you implement it ?
//What is the functional difference between these two declarations:
char * string1="string";
char string2[]="string";

//Reverse a linked list
// level order
// trie
//Had to write code to find the minimum element in a BST and also find the next largest element from the current node in the BST. Then had to explain what a function did (printed all the elements in the BST in increasing order). Also had to given the time complexities of all these functions.
If a program is forked.The parent and child have a printf   statement.What will be the order of the printf statements?

It will not be in any particular order as the CPU keeps on swapping between the parent and child process.

# and ## operators
In function-like macros, a # operator before an identifier in the replacement-list runs the identifier through parameter replacement and encloses the result in quotes, effectively creating a string literal. In addition, the preprocessor adds backslashes to escape the quotes surrounding embedded string literals, if any, and doubles the backslashes within the string as necessary. All leading and trailing whitespace is removed, and any sequence of whitespace in the middle of the text (but not inside embedded string literals) is collapsed to a single space. This operation is called "stringification". If the result of stringification is not a valid string literal, the behavior is undefined.
When # appears before __VA_ARGS__, the entire expanded __VA_ARGS__ is enclosed in quotes:
#define showlist(...) puts(#__VA_ARGS__)
showlist();            // expands to puts("")
showlist(1, "x", int); // expands to puts("1, \"x\", int")
(since C++11)
A ## operator between any two successive identifiers in the replacement-list runs parameter replacement on the two identifiers (which are not macro-expanded first) and then concatenates the result. This operation is called "concatenation" or "token pasting". Only tokens that form a valid token together may be pasted: identifiers that form a longer identifier, digits that form a number, or operators + and = that form a +=. A comment cannot be created by pasting / and * because comments are removed from text before macro substitution is considered. If the result of concatenation is not a valid token, the behavior is undefined.
Note: some compilers offer an extension that allows ## to appear after a comma and before __VA_ARGS__, in which case the ## does nothing when __VA_ARGS__ is non-empty, but removes the comma when __VA_ARGS__ is empty: this makes it possible to define macros such as fprintf (stderr, format, ##__VA_ARGS__)

Basically, your base class is a struct; derived structs must include the base struct at the first position, so that a pointer to the "derived" struct will also be a valid pointer to the base struct.

typedef struct {
   data member_x;
} base;

typedef struct {
   struct base;
   data member_y;
} derived;

void function_on_base(struct base * a); // here I can pass both pointers to derived and to base

void function_on_derived(struct derived * b); // here I must pass a pointer to the derived class
The functions can be part of the structure as function pointers, so that a syntax like p->call(p) becomes possible, but you still have to explicitly pass a pointer to the struct to the function itself.

Interview Questions
Here is an implementation of a BST. Write a function in C to find the minimum node of the tree.
Answer Question
Write a function to find the next in-order successor of any given node in a BST.
Answer Question
A question about what the main function in C does and why it is important to know the difference between char, char pointer, char array, and a pointer to char pointer.

Print a string and print a string in reverse order?
In-order traverse a binary search tree.

Implement a stack in my favorite language
2) OS and computer systems questions: x86 stack frame, Linux kernel (?)

I applied online and had an on-campus interview. It is not very hard though something I cannot answer. What is the difference between process and thread? How can processes communicate with each other? BST find the minimum node. BST find the node with next larger value of a given value.
