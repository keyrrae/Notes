*Database*
The overall container for a collection of MySQL data

*Table*
A subcontainer within a database that stores the actual data.

*Row*
A single record within a table, which may contain several fields

*Column*
The name of a field within a row.

`$ mysql -u root -p`

Login as root user without a password.

`mysql> SHOW databases;`

**Don't press Ctrl-C to cancel a command**, it will close the program

Cancel: `\c`

`meaningless gibberish to mysql \c`

Don't use `\c` inside a string or after a semicolon, it won't work


- SQL commands and keywords are case-insensitive
- the recommended style is to use uppercase
- Table names are case-sensitive on Linux and OS X
- the recommended style is to use lowercase or mixed for table names

###Creating a database
`CREATE DATABASE publications;`
`USE publications`

### Creating users

`GRANT` : create a user

`GRANT PRIVILEGES ON database.object TO 'username'@'hostname' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';`

| Arguments      |  Meaning |
| :------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| \*.\*          | All databases and all their objects       |
| database.\*    | Only the database called *databse* and all its objects       |
| database.object| Only the database called *databse* and its object called *object*       |


`CRANT ALL ON publications.* TO 'jim'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypassword';`

login as jim:

`mysql -u jim -p`

### Creating a table

```SQL
CREATE TABLE classics(
  author VARCHAR(128),
  title VARCHAR(128),
  type VARCHAR(16),
  year CHAR(4)
) ENGINE MyISAM;
```

To check whether new table has been created:

`DESCRIBE classics;`

```MySQL
mysql> USE publications;
Database changed

mysql> CREATE TABLE classics (
 -> author VARCHAR(128),
 -> title VARCHAR(128),
 -> type VARCHAR(16),
 -> year CHAR(4)) ENGINE MyISAM;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)

mysql> DESCRIBE classics;
+--------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field | Type | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+--------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| author | varchar(128) | YES | | NULL | |
| title | varchar(128) | YES | | NULL | |
| type | varchar(16) | YES | | NULL | |
| year | char(4) | YES | | NULL | |
+--------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)

```

### Datatypes
`VARCHAR`: VARiable length CHARacter string

`VARCHAR(128)`: maximum length 128

`CHAR(4)`:  fixed length character string

Data type Bytes used Examples
CHAR(n) Exactly n (<= 255) CHAR(5): “Hello” uses 5 bytes
CHAR(57): “New York” uses 57 bytes
VARCHAR(n) Up to n (<= 65535) VARCHAR(100): “Greetings” uses 9 bytes plus 1 byte overhead
VARCHAR(7): “Morning” uses 7 bytes plus 1 byte overhead

Data type Bytes used Examples
BINARY(n) or BYTE(n) Exactly n (<= 255) As for CHAR, but contains binary data
VARBINARY(n) Up to n (<= 65535) As for VARCHAR, but contains binary data

Data type Bytes used Attributes
TINYTEXT(n) Up to n (<= 255) Treated as a string with a character set
TEXT(n) Up to n (<= 65535) Treated as a string with a character set
MEDIUMTEXT(n) Up to n (<= 16777215) Treated as a string with a character set
LONGTEXT(n) Up to n (<= 4294967295) Treated as a string with a character set

CREATE TABLE tablename (fieldname INT(4) ZEROFILL);
CREATE TABLE tablename (fieldname INT(4) ZEROFILL);
```

DATE and TIME

Data type Time/date format
DATETIME '0000-00-00 00:00:00'
DATE '0000-00-00'
TIMESTAMP '0000-00-00 00:00:00'
TIME '00:00:00'
YEAR 0000 (Only years 0000 and 1901 - 2155)

TIMESTAMP: 1970 2037


The AUTO_INCREMENT data type
INT UNSIGNED
Makes the column take an integer large enough for you to store more than four
billion records in the table.
NOT NULL
Ensures that every column has a value. Many programmers use NULL in a field to
indicate that the field doesn’t have a value, but that would allow duplicates, which
would violate the whole reason for this column’s existence. So, we disallow NULL
values.
AUTO_INCREMENT
Causes MySQL to set a unique value for this column in every row, as described
earlier. We don’t really have control over the value that this column will take in
each row, but we don’t care: all we care about is that we are guaranteed a unique
value.
KEY
An autoincrementing column is useful as a key, because you will tend to search for
rows based on this column.

CREATE TABLE classics (
 author VARCHAR(128),
 title VARCHAR(128),
 type VARCHAR(16),
 year CHAR(4),
 id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT KEY) ENGINE MyISAM;

 ALTER TABLE classics DROP id;
